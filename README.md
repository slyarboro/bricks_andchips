# Game On Track

Formerly known as _'BricksAndChips'_, this fact skill is devoted to Christopher Wallace and the game that, he alleged, made him an animal.

To prevent one's wig from being pushed back, Wallace curated a manual years ago to provide guidance on how to keep one's game on track. This skill provides not only the individual steps themselves, but also breadth of the circumstances that inspired its penning. Formerly presented as somewhat of a circumscribed curriculum, this skill seeks to empower its users with a deeper understanding of the raw motivations behind its creation and the subsequent scope of its worth.


_Delivers single fact per user prompt. Identifies prompt message alone; operates accordingly. Does not discern one voice from another, allowing multiple users._
